# Pantarheon Foťák
## An Open Camera

What is a foťák, you might ask. Quite simply, in my native tongue we have two different words for a camera. One is _kamera,_ which we use for cinema, television, and video cameras. Cameras that capture a movement.

The other is _fotoaparát,_ which we use for the cameras used
in the art and craft of photography. Cameras that capture a
moment.

And _foťák_ is just a shortened, slangy, version of
_fotoaparát._

I grew up with film photography. My father had a two-lens _Voigtländer_ camera for the 6x6 cm film, a camera he probably got sometime before World War II (he was born in 1904, while I was born in 1950). I still have it.

My own first camera was an _Efekta,_ which was make out of bakelite, had a fixed-focus plastic lens, and used the same
type of film as my Dad’s camera, except it allowed me to shoot
at 6x9 cm. A very simple camera, but it gave me great looking pictures simply because of the size of the negatives. Alas
with my moving around the world, I no longer have it.

Recently I felt nostalgic for the simple cameras of lore that produced such great pictures. I bought a used _Cambo
Legend,_ a view camera that uses the 4x5" film. It came with a nice 210 mm lens, a bellows, and a _Graflok_ compatible back.
It works properly except it can no longer shift the standards
left and right (which I knew about before I bought it). At
first I did not realize the back was _Graflok_ compatible, so I bought a brand new _Cambo_ back.

Then I saw an offer for a fully functional _Cambo Legend_
body, so I bought that, too. It did not come with a lens, but
it did include the bellows and a back.

So now I have one fully functional _Cambo Legend_ camera, one
mostly functional camera of the same make and model, one lens,
two bellows, and three backs. I have more spare parts than
cameras. And since the _Cambo Legend_ weighs way too much for
someone my age to carry around (in all fairness it was always
designed to be a studio camera), I decided to design and
3D-print a portable camera for all those accessories.

As of this writing (late October 2022), most of the design
lives mostly in my head. But I shall update this project as
it materializes.
